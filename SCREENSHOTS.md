# Screenshots Guide

## Current Status

The repository currently contains **placeholder SVG screenshots** in the `assets/screenshots/` directory. These are temporary placeholders that should be replaced with actual screenshots of the plugin in action.

## Creating Real Screenshots

To replace the placeholders with real screenshots:

1. **Install the plugin** in a WordPress test environment
2. **Take screenshots** of:
   - Classic/Gutenberg editor with the Social Media Preview meta box visible
   - Elementor editor showing the floating preview button and panel
   - Settings page at Settings > OG Preview

3. **Screenshot specifications**:
   - Format: PNG or JPEG
   - Recommended width: 1200-1920px
   - Ensure UI is clean and professional
   - Crop to show relevant areas

4. **Save screenshots** in `assets/screenshots/` with these names:
   - `classic-editor-preview.png` (or `.jpg`)
   - `elementor-preview.png` (or `.jpg`)
   - `settings-page.png` (or `.jpg`)

5. **Update README.md** to reference the new file extensions:
   - Change `.svg` to `.png` (or `.jpg`) in the image links

## Current Placeholder Files

- `classic-editor-preview.svg` - Placeholder for Classic/Gutenberg editor screenshot
- `elementor-preview.svg` - Placeholder for Elementor integration screenshot
- `settings-page.svg` - Placeholder for settings page screenshot

## Notes

- SVG placeholders are intentionally simple to indicate where real screenshots should go
- Once real screenshots are added, delete this SCREENSHOTS.md file and the SVG placeholders
- Real screenshots will make the README much more compelling for potential users
